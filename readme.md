# Gilded Convert Script
# Created by InepsaOG and shared with the VORP community

### This script is incredibly handy and we use it for literally hundreds of items on our live server
### Provided in the CFG is a tiny snippet of what we use to give you ideas

# Requirements
### Up to date Vorp Core and Inventory
### We utilize vorp_animations
### Ensure that vorp_animations is started before gilded_convert in your resources or server cfg files

# Features
### Open cigarette packs, crates that carry ore, pack cigarettes into packages
### Turn an item or a list of items into a weapon with a double click
### Animations per item!
### Random item option for things like grab bags
### Notifications for everything take, given etc.

# Potenitally adding in
### Webhooks. Used to have them but not incredibly useful information so im 50/50 on them
### Take in actual weapons to break down into parts
